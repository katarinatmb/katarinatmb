# 👋 Hi, I'm Katarina!

**Registered Nurse (BSN) | Masters in Data Science (MSDS)**

<p>I am an experienced registered nurse with a Bachelor’s degree in Nursing and a passion for leveraging data to improve healthcare outcomes. I have a Master’s in Applied Data Science, where I am building expertise in data analytics, visualization, and statistical modeling. My unique background at the bedside and in the classroom allows me to bridge the gap between clinical practice and data-driven healthcare solutions.</p>

## 🩺 Professional Interests

- Healthcare analytics & informatics
- Data visualization & storytelling
- Evidence-based practice improvement
- Translating clinical experience into actionable insights

## 💻 Technical Skills

- **Languages:** R, Python, SQL
- **Tools:** RStudio, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Tableau, Shiny, PyTorch, Opencv  
- **Methods:** Data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning, reproducible research

## 📈 Featured Projects

- **[Predicting Gastrointenstianl Illness Severity from Beach Water Quality](https://github.com/katarinatmb/beach-illness-ml)**
  This project explores how microbial water contamination and swimmer exposure relate to gastrointestinal (GI) illness severity among beachgoers. Using the Santa Monica Bay Epidemiological   Study dataset, the analysis compares multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluates their usefulness in environmental health risk prediction using Python.

- **[Eye-Based Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/katarinatmb/eye-heart-disease-ml)**
  I developed a machine learning pipeline that analyzes retinal fundus images to explore whether subtle ocular features can predict heart disease. The project includes image preprocessing,      CNN modeling, logistic regression benchmarking, and full evaluation with accuracy and classification metrics. This work highlights the potential of non-invasive imaging as an early            cardiovascular screening tool.

- **[Novi Sad, Serbia Protest Analysis](https://katarinatmb.github.io/serbia-protest-analysis/)**  
  Analyzing protest patterns by group type, region, and frequency after the Novi Sad train station roof collapse in Serbia using RStudio.

- **[Predicting Heart Disease from Clinical and Demographic Data](https://github.com/katarinatmb/predict-heart-disease)**
   This project applies machine learning to predict heart disease presence using clinical 
and demographic data from the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The goal was to compare three distinct 
machine learning approaches: a Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive 
Bayes classifier, to determine which model provides the most reliable and balanced predictions for 
clinical decision support.
