## 📈 Featured Projects

###  Multi-Modal Cardiovascular Disease Detection Series
*Exploring non-invasive cardiovascular screening through complementary imaging modalities*

- **[Eye-Based Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/katarinatmb/eye-heart-disease-ml)** (AUC: 0.732)  
  Developed a machine learning pipeline analyzing retinal fundus images using CNNs and logistic regression to predict cardiovascular disease from subtle ocular features. This project demonstrates the potential of microvascular eye patterns as early screening biomarkers and serves as the foundation for multi-modal diagnostic research.

- **[Tongue-Based Heart Disease Detection](https://github.com/katarinatmb/Tongue-Based-Detection)** (AUC: 0.605)  
  Applied deep learning CNNs to tongue photographs, building upon Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnostic principles to detect cardiovascular disease through automated image analysis. This complementary approach involved extensive manual quality control of non-standardized images and establishes proof-of-concept for computational tongue diagnosis.

- **[Predicting Gastrointenstianl Illness Severity from Beach Water Quality](https://github.com/katarinatmb/beach-illness-ml)**
  This project explores how microbial water contamination and swimmer exposure relate to gastrointestinal (GI) illness severity among beachgoers. Using the Santa Monica Bay Epidemiological   Study dataset, the analysis compares multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluates their usefulness in environmental health risk prediction using Python.

- **[Novi Sad, Serbia Protest Analysis](https://katarinatmb.github.io/serbia-protest-analysis/)**  
  Analyzing protest patterns by group type, region, and frequency after the Novi Sad train station roof collapse in Serbia using RStudio.

- **[Predicting Heart Disease from Clinical and Demographic Data](https://github.com/katarinatmb/predict-heart-disease)**
   This project applies machine learning to predict heart disease presence using clinical 
and demographic data from the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The goal was to compare three distinct 
machine learning approaches: a Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive 
Bayes classifier, to determine which model provides the most reliable and balanced predictions for 
clinical decision support.
